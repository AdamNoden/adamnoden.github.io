### Core principles

- Organisms with faster metabolic rates have longer lifespans
- High metabolic rate is a pre-requisite for self repair and regeneration
- An ideal metabolic state is found in adolescence: high thyroid function, high pulse, warm body
- Aging and disease are due to an accumulation of stress hormones
- A poor metabolism impairs a normal defensive response to stress
- Stress can be from external events but also an internal 'stress response' can result from internal biology

### Hormones cheat-sheet

- Serotonin bad
- Estrogen always bad
- Cortisol bad
- Dopamine good
- Androgens good
- D3 good
- Pregnenolone good
- Progesterone very god

### Stress/Lactic acid

- A measure of good health is being able to recover quickly from acute episodes of stress
- Once glycogen stores becomes low, adrenaline begins to rise and once it reaches a certain level cortisol is released
- Falling blood sugar and rising lactic acid is the universal sign of stress
- Lactic acid is the main source for producing endorphins or endogenous opiates, therefore endorphins are a sign of stress
- Chronic elevated lactic acid is correlated with cancer
- Excessive lactic acid from can get produced during grueling endurance exercises (long distance running etc.)
- Increasing CO2 by breathing into bag can lower lactic acid
- Being at a higher altitude also increases CO2
- Hyperventilation releases a lot of CO2. CO2 is a nerve stabilizer. Retaining CO2 leads to clearer thinking
- Glucose and cholesterol are protective against stress
- Cholesterol rises during stress because it is a precursor to steroidal anti-stress hormones (cholesterol is precursor to all steroidal hormones)
- Stress will make you lose copper from from your respiratory system

### Thyroid/metabolism

- Hypothyroid: thyroid activity below normal
- Cold hands and feet, low blood, anxiety, fatigue, depression, edema, and frequent hunger are signs of hypothyroidism
- Temperature in general is a good gauge of metabolism
- Normally, you want body temperature to increase from morning to midday
- Digestion slows down when metabolic rate slows down from hypothyroid
- Thyroid, progesterone, and DHEA help maintain a high metabolic rate, even at rest
- T3 is the essential active hormone. Under stress T4 is converted to release T3
- T4 and T3 alone can't be used to interpret thyroid function for this reason
- Any area or tissue with excess lactic acid, inflammation, or hypoxic conditions can locally destroy active T3
- PUFA is harmful for metabolism because it blocks thyroid secretion from the gland, blocks transport in the bloodstream, and blocks in several places in the cell
- Beans and cabbage can damage thyroid. Low protein and iodine may also negatively affect the thyroid

### Cortisol

- Cortisol causes catabolic effect on muscles
- Cortisol can dissolve tissues like the thymus to get sugars when blood sugars drop. Next, muscles will be broken down
- Carbohydrates in form of fructose can help spare amino acid loss from cortisol
- Fructose pre-workout to replenish muscle & liver glycogen so metabolism stays high which helps to recover faster & prevent muscle wasting for glycogen
- Sugar inhibits cortisol which turns protein into sugars. Sugar also aids in the digestion of protein
- Cortisol releases stored PUFA which is a stressor and can damage tissues
- Stable glucose levels prevent cortisol from rising

### Exercise

- Concentric lifting 'wills' mitochondria into existence
- Non-concentric: more 'pump' but this is damaged estrogen producing water logged tissue
- Endurance exercise causes heart atrophy, reduction of testosterone, reduction of fertility, and lungs become inflamed

### Serotonin

- Reduce serotonin by reducing intestinal inflammation, avoid resistant starches, avoid salads, and avoid undercooked vegetables.
- Serotonin increases estrogen
- Endotoxin leads to inflamed intestines releases serotonin into bloodstream which can cross the blood brain barrier and cause a stress response.
- This will release even more serotonin causing vicious circle
- Serotonin is produced in the intestine. Is carried in bloodstream and detoxified in the lungs. Overwork of the lungs can cause a dump of serotonin by blood platelets and increase inflammation. Any systemic stress that causes loss of CO2 will increase this
- Rising levels of serotonin gradually devolve an organism into a reductive metabolic state
- Being startled easily might be a tell for high serotonin
- May be linked to autistic offspring, or low bone density
- Serotonin antagonists: cyproheptadine, lsd, n 10-Methoxyharmalan

### Testosterone

- Having more muscle mass is healthy and can help produce testosterone and lower cortisol
- Testosterone also can help heart and brain
- Muscle also serves as energy reserve during stressful catabolic events
- Endotoxins are estrogenic and lowers testosterone and progesterone

### Progesterone

- Progesterone is highly concentrated in the brain.
- May oppose testosterone in excess
- May help with epilepsy or arthritis
- Progesterone's anti-estrogen effect has been successfully used to treat some uterine and breast cancers

### Estrogen

- Men experience an increase in estrogen when in chronic stress or after a traumatic accident
- Endotoxins are estrogenic and trigger cortisol
- Excess estrogen or low thyroid can hamper livers ability to store glycogen
- Celery, parsley, and aspirin are anti-estrogenic

### Fasting

- Fasting is catabolic and will consume healthy tissues to acquire glucose
- Fasting increases cortisol and metabolic rate higher for first few days until metabolism is down-regulated due to low amount of sugar and high amount of amino acids in blood
- Hormonal glands down-regulated
- Fasting releases PUFAs which oxidize. Destroys enzymes ability to produce energy
- Failure to produce energy causes a stress response
- Depending on efficiency of liver, time without food until stress response varies
- Fasting is especially catabolic because the metabolism remains high then once blood sugar drops (stressor) the body will quickly consume thymus and muscles for fuel
- Eventually metabolism will down-regulate (so body doesn't consume itself) and this will down-regulate hormonal glands
- Physiologically speaking, the human body doesn't distinguish between famine and carb restriction

### Sugar

- Fructose and lactose are preferred forms of sugar
- Fructose and lactose are usually absorbed within first foot or so of the intestine
- Sucrose and lactose are effective at maintaining production of thyroid hormones
- If diet doesn't provide glucose and fructose then the liver can't make thyroid (T4 to T3)
- Fructose is metabolized quickly without spiking insulin (stressor). This Fructose quickly replenishes glycogen in liver
- Animals with tumor normally have stable blood sugar even when cutting supply off. Cancer will send stress hormones to release sugar. Also cancer will consume surrounding tissue. In studies cancer will consume high concentrations of sugar until it died
- Healthy people store about 7-8 ounces of glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver, muscles, and brain
- You want sugars that don't strongly stimulate insulin which leads to storage as fat
- Fructose moderates production of fat, raises temperature, increases conversion of carbohydrates to energy, and activates the thyroid better than glucose alone
- Fruit, honey, and white sugar are preferred sources of fructose
- "Browning" sugar breaks it down and produces irritating possibly toxic materials
- As liver glycogen drops body will become stressed (catabolic) and began consuming, thymus, and muscle

### Fruit

- Fruit is the best food for not triggering a stress response
- Potassium handles sugar in place of insulin and helps lower glycemic load of carbohydrate
- Eating fruit produces less insulin and cortisol than other foods
- Fruit juice has more minerals than refined carbs
- Juicy fruits should be eaten raw
- Starchy fruits should be cooked
- Undercooked starch particles can enter bloodstream and block capillaries killing cells and organs
- Undigested starches causes endotoxins via bacterial overgrowth that can inflame intestines and liver
- Orange juice, guava, and others contain anti-aromatase chemicals (good)
- Marmalade recommended. the peels are rich in antiinflammatory chemicals, more than the juice

### Milk

- A 'complete food' (optimal: pasture raised, un-pasteurized, un-homogenized)
- Milk slows absorption of lactose and calcium stimulates metabolism to increase use of sugars

### Coconut oil

- 98% saturated fat full of various 'curious' compounds

### Coffee

- Coffee is a rich nutritional source of magnesium
- Coconut oil can have an antihistamine effect and can help moderate coffee's negative effects along with sugar
- Caffeine if taken on an empty stomach will drop blood sugar and stimulate stress. Best if taken with food.
- Coffee filters heavy metals from water when using the drip method

### Vegetables

- Potatoes when thoroughly cooked (say boiled in water then roasted) are good
- Best when eaten with butter or other saturated fat

### Carrots

- Carrot isn't digestible and has slightly antimicrobial properties
- Carrot fiber helps remove those toxins from small intestine
- Carrots, as root vegetables, have natural antibiotics to protect against funguses and bacteria while they are in the ground
- Consumption of a raw carrot will move the carrot fibers through your digestive system and eliminate overgrowth while also absorbing other toxins and carrying them out of you

### Protein

- Beef and lamb are preferred over chicken, pork, and turkey due to ruminants having less unsaturated fat due to nature of digestive system
- Eating big dose of protein without sugar you stimulate insulin which lowers circulating glucose and turns it into fat. Lower blood glucose also releases cortisol
- Some fruit is good about 30 minutes before a high protein meal because the fruit replenishes the liver with glycogen this helps blunt insulin response
- Important to have more calcium than phosphate (high in muscle meats)
- The main negative effect of muscle meat is its high tryptophan content. Use bone broth or gelatine to balance
- Gelatin is free from age inducing amino acids
- Since excess tryptophan is known to produce muscle pain, myositis, even muscular dystrophy, gelatin is an appropriate food for helping to correct those problems

### Fats and PUFAs

- Saturated fats inhibit stress hormones by preventing release of PUFAs from storage
- Saturated fats help inhibit inflammation and act as liver protectors
- Small amount of fat helps stimulate the intestines and absorb fat-soluble vitamins
- Small amount of PUFA fats in natural fat sources are stored gradually overtime as the body preferably metabolizes saturated fat
- This slow accumulation of PUFA in the body overtime leads to aging
- Under stress fat is released (PUFA) so stress becomes more harmful over time as we age since more PUFAs have been accumulated and can be released
- Fibrotic, clotting, inflammatory, and tumor diseases are all closely associated with PUFA
- PUFA is metabolized preferentially over saturated fat
- Degenerative diseases are all associated with disturbances involving fat metabolism and lipid peroxidation
- The quantity of PUFA in the tissues strongly determines the susceptibility of the tissue to injury by radiation and other stresses

### Eggs

- Extremely concentrated protein
- Eat with sugars and carbohydrates or blood sugar will fall, especially if liver doesn't have good glycogen stores

### Misc nutrition

- Seafood and liver recommended weekly
- Milk, liver, cheese, eggs, meat, and seafood are good sources of B vitamins
- Will help neuromuscular and cognitive function
- Eating too much pure protein/protein only meals causes a fall of blood sugar and increase of cortisol which is catobolic to muscles and thymus
- Leaky gut may be caused by radiation, estrogen, PUFA, heavy metals
- Leaky gut is when intestines become inflamed and leaky capillaries destroys the barrier between substances in intestine and blood and affects other tissues and organs via the blood stream
- Eating too many fermented food may cause stress due to lowering blood sugar via lactic acid
- Sugar, progesterone, and aspirin are things that will protect you for most surges of histamine, serotonin, etc
- A small sweet snack before bed may help you sleep through the night
- Gelatinous foods like jello or soups are also recommended to be consumed regularly

### Pregnancy nutrition

- Glucose in eggs/embryo stimulates brain growth
- Removal of glucose in eggs/embryo increases death of brain cells
- Progesterone (aka Progest E) also helps with metabolism of glucose and helps prevent miscarriages
- High estrogen increases chance of miscarriage
- Vitamin E helps maintain fertility and prevent miscarriage
- Women who suffer high Estrogen during pregnancy often keep a pseudo-cycle of bleeding each month when the Estrogen spikes, it's when most spontaneous abortion occurs
- High progesterone during pregnancy = No menstrual cycle manifested
- "Ovarian reserves" are not limited and increase with Vitamin D3 and small dose DHEA.
- Female fertility in old age can be restored with Niacinamide and red light

### Vitamins/minerals

- Aspirin improves calcium retention in bones and is safe if taken along with vitamin K
- Vitamin K regulates calcium, protects arteries from calcification, and allows bones to use CO2
- Vitamin K can reverse osteoporosis and remove calcium from the arteries
- Vitamin E needs increase with age and PUFA intake. Quality supplemental vitamin E is extremely hard to find
- A little extra vitamin E (such as 100 units per day) will take care of an occasional PUFA laden restaurant meal
- Vitamin B1 is correlated with short term memory and improves mood. Often lowered by stress
- B1 deficiency causes sluggishness, poor mood, psychosis, and hallucinations.
- Advised to take B1 prior to entering known stressful activity (exam etc.). Dose recommended: 10mg up to 100mg
- Vitamin D is a regulatory material in bone and hair growth
- Vitamin A activates enzymes that make steroids
- Vitamin A increases ability to make pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA.
- Brain is a major steroid forming organ along with skin and gonads.
- Calcium deficiency is responsible for high blood pressure
- Calcium helps up-regulate the metabolism
- Calcium(& vit D) decreases parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid causes aldosterone to increase. Aldosterone removes calcium from bones and moves it into soft tissues
- Titanium dioxide and silica dioxide are found in many food supplements and can cause inflammation in the brain via small intestines
- Enemas and laxatives were one of the oldest treatments for cancer. PUFA originally became viewed as healthy because in high doses it is a laxative
- Thiamine helps lower lactic acid and increase CO2
- Vitamin E and K are best taken at different times

### Salt

- Salt consumption inversely correlated with blood pressure
- Stress and aging can make it harder to retain sodium
- Loss of sodium releases aldosterone which causes magnesium loss. Sodium is magnesium sparing.
- Sugar and salt can help lower adrenaline. (Good before bed)
- It seems to consistently lower aldosterone and prolactin, helps with increased stomach acid leading to less bacterial load/endotoxin down the digestive tract, seems to help with edema especially nighttime ones, ATP boost

### Diabetes

- If you are low thyroid you will have problems regulating blood sugar
- Experiments with people with diabetes: patients who were allowed to eat as much sucrose as they wanted eventually recovered
- Type 1 diabetes may be a type of autoimmune disease. Inflammation reaction to prostaglandins and PUFA. Saturated fat only diets didn't develop experimental diabetes in studies
- Diabetes symptoms with normal blood sugar may be be caused by damaged/undigested starches and PUFA
- Frequent eating is less stressful and less likely to cause diabetes and fat storage
- Diabetics are deficient in fructose, they metabolize it the same or faster than healthy people
- PUFA has increased diabetes in general population
- Fruit and cheese are safe for diabetics because they don't trigger a large insulin response from pancreas. White sugar, honey, milk also good. Avoid starches
- Diabetes is a failure to oxidize sugar properly and turning sugar into lactic acid. Lactic acid displaces CO2. Loss of CO2 causes serotonin exposure.

### Liver

- Is the chemist for the body
- Liver helps make thyroid hormones
- Good digestion leads to less liver strain which leads to better thyroid etc
- A damaged liver will ruin the whole organism
- If the liver is not getting enough protein or B vitamins it can lose its ability to detoxify
- Healthy liver should be able to store 8 hours of glycogen to get you through the night
- If thyroid is low or estrogen is high then liver may have difficulty storing glycogen
- After liver glycogen is empty and can't respond to adrenaline, cortisol is released, and turns protein and fat into glucose
- Stomach, pancreas, and liver should wash your whole small intestine clean so that there no bacteria can thrive when thyroid is functioning well
- If liver is working, protein intake is adequate, and your thyroid is functioning, the liver will send the estrogen to your kidneys after progesterone retrieves it from cells of the body and brings it to the liver
- Potato juice can absorb ammonia for those with failing livers
- You want to ensure healthy small intestine and ensure you get endotoxins out. This way Liver can be healthy and produce thyroid hormone
- Saturated fats and cholesterol help protect liver from endotoxins
- Excessive sour fermented dairy not recommended due to liver having to process lactic acid and slowing metabolism

### Digestion/intestines

- IBS is an inflamed bowel
- Gluten resembles a protein that tissues make under the influence of estrogen or stress
- Seeds contain toxins to protect against digestion
- The more indigestible the food the more it supports bacterial growth
- Greek yogurt is preferred over very acidic yogurts. Higher lactic acid in sour yogurts from bacteria increases inflammation
- Inflammation of nose and throat often starts in the intestine. Close relationship between respiratory system and digestive system
- Inflamed intestines may inflame the urinary system or prostate and cause frequent urination
- Sometimes you get overgrowth of toxins in small intestine. Resistant starches help feed these bacteria. Bacteria can release lactic acid which puts additional strain on liver and depletes its glycogen
- Carrot salad with vinegar and coconut oil can help rid these bacteria
- Fungal overgrowth can be treated with Sulphur containing compounds
- Damaged intestinal walls can allow endotoxins to leak into the bloodstream
- The toxins can trigger an allergic response(stressor) via histamines
- Some toxins can penetrate the blood brain barrier. Brain can also act as a filter

### Light

- Red light therapy is good
- Avoid intense midday sunlight to mitigate oxidative damage stress which can affect pufa. Damage is not localized to skin.
- Darkness is stressful and cortisol producing
- Cortisol is normally highest in morning after fasting and being in darkness
- Red light neutralizes harmful effects of blue light
- UV light primarily damages cells by oxidizing PUFA. Aspirin can help manage this. Best to avoid harmful radiation and EMF
- EMF is estrogenic in nature
- Blue light in absence of red light is damaging to mitochondria

### Toxins

- There are two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The nonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic and carcinogenic.
- It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can use a little "refrigerator magnet" to test your pans. The magnet will stick firmly to the safer type of pan.
- Just washing the skin with pure soap/shampoo alters the skin's endocrine function for days. and doing it every day is an "endocrine disruptor," even if there are no toxic additives in the soap.
- X-rays: Cancerogenic, cause of enormous cellular stress, pretty much an internal car crash, more estrogenic than HRT

### Basic Rules of Metabolism:

- If it improves metabolism it will usually increase the need for fuel
- If not enough fuel is available a stress response will ensue
- A stress response can easily be confused with a 'fast' thyroid metabolism
- Improving thyroid energy metabolism and reducing stress will show you how tired you really are
- Improving energy metabolism can bring up deficiencies, imbalances and other issues...including digestion issues
- Pumping up metabolism rapidly without first reducing stress related issues is generally unwise
- Tracking pulse and temperature changes before and after eating is a great way to know what's happening with metabolism
- The nervous system can override metabolism but improving metabolism also improves nervous system issues

### Alzheimer's/Dementia

- Can be worsened by 'omega-3' supplements or fish oil supplements
- Coconut oil can help
- High quality ice-cream can help (saturared fat and sugar), avoid carrageenan
- Shine red light directly on the skull
