# Kate Deering on Metabolism

Cliff notes from "How to Heal Your Metabolism" by Kate Deering.

### Sugar

Sugar increases metabolism. When I am referring to sugar, I am referring to natural, organic foods that contain fructose, glucose, lactose, and sucrose. To be more specific, I am referring to most organic fruits, organic root vegetables like potatoes and carrots, organic dairy, some pulp-free fruit juices, raw organic honey, and, yes, even refined white sugar. I am not referring to carbohydrates or sugars that have been processed. These include processed high fructose corn syrup(HFS), agave, soda, cookies, cakes, candy, crackers, sports and energy drinks, and frozen desserts. I am also not referring to complex carbohydrates or most starchy carbs like grains, breads, pasta, rice, and corn.

Simple sugars like fructose, glucose, sucrose, and lactose are your best sources. These include: fruits, honey, milk, white sugar, fruit juices, and root vegetables.

Carbohydrates should never be eaten alone. Always combine carbohydrates with a fat and protein (e.g., fruit and cheese, eggs and OJ, and milk and honey). (See Appendix A for a list of optimal carbohydrates.)

### Vegetables

Leafy green vegetables like kale, spinach, chard, and lettuce contain anti-nutrients. They consist of oxalates, lectins, lignans, and polyunsaturated fats.

Too much fiber or the wrong type fiber can disrupt proper digestion, increase toxic load, and damage the cell walls of the intestines and gut.

Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, bok choy, and cabbage are goitrogenic. Cruciferous vegetables inhibit proper thyroid function.

Root vegetables like sweet potatoes, white potatoes, yams, beets, and turnips, and the fruit-vegetables like pumpkin, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes are safer vegetables. Since the roots grow below ground they have fewer anti-nutrients. Roots should be cooked well and eaten with a fat.

Consume one to two organic raw carrots a day for the carrot's anti-fungal, anti-estrogenic, and anti-bacterial properties.

### Potato protein

Potatoes are a good source of quality protein. The very high value of "potato protein' is better than the egg yolk, because there is material besides the actual protein that functions as protein: keto acids.

Potato's keto acids are the equivalent of the essential amino acids. In the body, ammonia is added to keto acids, turning them into amino acids. According to nutrition researcher Ray Peat, PhD, "Two pounds of well-cooked mashed potato has the protein value similar to a liter of milk, about 33 grams of protein. A person would be able to live for a long time on either two or three liters of milk or 4-6 pounds of potatoes per day. The milk drinker would eventually need to supplement iron, the potato eater would need to supplement vitamin A, possibly B12, but both of them are nearly perfect foods." The well-cooked white potato also contains humerous vitamins and minerals, including vitamins C, D, and K. folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, B6, choline, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, iron, and zinc. The potato lacks adequate Vitamin A and B12.

### Misc

Milk is the perfect balance of fat, carbs, and protein. It contains high calcium content and is filled with other vitamins and minerals.

Pastured-organic eggs are filled with protein, fat, carotenoids, vitamins A, E, D, and K, calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, thiamin, B6, folate, B12, pantothenic acid, choline, potassium, magnesium, copper, manganese, and selenium.

Grass-fed beef liver is one of the most nutritionally packed foods on the planet, with high levels of vitamin A and the B vitamins. Liver also includes vitamins D, E, and K, calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, copper, zinc, and phosphorus.

Shellfish and low-fat fish are filled with easy-to-digest protein and are filled with vitamins A, C, D, and E and the B vitamins. Shellfish also include zinc, copper, selenium, iron, magnesium, sodium, and manganese.

Potato protein is a high-quality protein due to its keto acids. Potatoes also contain vitamins C, D, and K, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, B6, choline, calcium, potassium magnesium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, iron, and zinc.

Gelatin and bone broth have been used to treat not only the common cold but gastrointestinal issues, joint pain, depression, constipation, liver support, anti-aging, and improved hair, skin, nail, and bone health. Bone broth and gelatin lack the inflammatory amino acids and are rich in anti-inflammatory amino acids alanine, hydroxyproline, proline, and especially glycine

Salt is an important supplement used to raise metabolic rate, and reduce inflammation and cramping. It helps magnesium absorption, helps relieve constipation, improves
sleep, helps decrease stress hormones, and can actually help in lowering blood pressure. Use a clean white source of salt, and salt food to taste.

Coffee is a powerful thermogenic and should be consumed with cream, sugar, and/or food to decrease the blood- sugar-lowering effect it will have consumed on its own. Coffee protects the liver from drugs and alcohol. Coffee helps with constipation. Coffee drinkers have lower levels of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, thyroid disease, and suicide.

### Meat

Muscle meats consist of chicken, pork, beef, bison, venison, turkey, and lamb.

The downsides of muscle meats are their high phosphorus-to-calcium ratio, their high levels of the inflammatory amino acids, and the use of GM corn and soy used in their feed.

Grass-fed meats are preferred to conventional farmed meats due to their lower fat content, higher vitamin and mineral content, and higher CLA levels.

Consume all muscle meat with bone broth or gelatin to offset the amino acid profile.

The amount of muscle meat a person can handle safely is based on his or her size, activity, and metabolic health.

### Nuts

Nuts and seeds are not a good source of protein. Only 13-30 percent of the nut is protein, seeds even less. in addition, seeds and nuts contain trypsin inhibitors, which inhibit protein digestion.

Nuts and seeds contain high levels of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs). These PUFAs decrease thyroid function, decrease digestive enzymes, and decrease the ability of the cell to produce energy. Macadamia, hazelnuts, and cashews are better nut choices due to their lower levels of PUFAs.

Nuts and seeds contain other anti-nutrients like oxalates, phytates, and lectins.

### Diabetes

Blood sugar concentration is the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. Most of us have ranges between 65mg/dI and 105mg/dI, depending on the day; physical, emotional, and environmental stresses; and what, how much, and when we eat. The body's goal is to keep blood sugar in these desirable ranges to achieve homeostasis so that you can feel energized, alert, and happy, and have an elevated metabolism all day long.

The problems occur when we either let our blood sugar fall too low or when we spike it up too high.

When our blood sugar drops too low, such as when we wait too long to eat, have chronic stress, over-exercise, starve ourselves, diet, or consume too much caffeine or alcohol, our body releases the stress hormones adrenaline, cortisol, and glucagon. These hormones are released to help raise blood sugar by breaking down glycogen stores (glycogenolysis- converting glycogen to glucose) and by breaking down glycerol, amino acids (muscle), lactate, and pyruvate (gluconeogenesis).

### Meal frequency

How often you eat will depend on how well your liver is storing glycogen. People who cannot store glycogen in the liver very well (hypoglycemic, diabetic, sensitive to sugar) should eat smaller meals more often. These smaller meals will create a constant flow of nutrients and energy, allowing the body to use the energy taken in without storing any of it as fat. Essentially, these small meals will take on the job of what your liver should be doing when you are not eating: maintaining blood sugar. As the liver begins to heal (removing toxins, PUFAs, and estrogenic foods; consuming the right saturated fats, proteins, and carbs), you will be able to store more liver glycogen and meals can become less frequent. If you are experiencing numerous metabolic issues, then eight to 10 small meals may be ideal for you. Most people do well on at least six meals. This may include three larger meals, ranging from 300 to 700 calories, and three smaller meals ranging from 100 to 300 calories.

### Misc

Balancing your blood sugar through the right macronutrient combinations (fats, carbs, proteins), meal size, and frequency is essential for healing a damaged metabolism.

Eating the right size meal means eating a meal that makes you feel good--not stuffed or hungry in an hour. The meal should make you feel warm and energized, not tired.

The optimal macronutrient amounts are dependent on the individual's size, age, sex, activity level, and the state of his or her metabolism. A good starting point for most people is to consume a meal with 50-percent carbs, 25-percent fat, and 25-percent protein. These numbers will shift as the person heals.

Meal frequency will depend on the person's metabolic rate, activity, and liver health. Healthier or less active people will be able to go longer without food due to the ability of the liver to store more glycogen or use less glycogen stores. Unhealthy or very active people will need to eat more frequently due to their inability to store liver glycogen or their high activity level.

### Pre-sleep snacks

Consume something sweet and salty an hour to 30 minutes before bed. Sugar and salt lower stress hormones. When blood sugar levels are maintained, stress hormones decrease and getting to sleep becomes easier.

Examples of sleepy nighttime snacks:

- Milk, raw honey, and a pinch of salt. The sugar (milk
  and honey) and salt will bring down stress hormones.
  In addition, the calcium from the milk is an anti-stress
  mineral used to decrease parathyroid hormone, a stress
  hormone.

- Pulp-free orange juice, gelatin, and a pinch of salt. The
  sugar (orange juice) and salt will bring down stress
  hormones. Gelatin is high in glycine. Glycine has anti-
  stress properties and has shown improvements in sleep.

- Bone broth, salt, and fruit. The sugar (fruit) and salt
  will bring down stress hormones. Bone broth contains
  the anti-stress amino acid glycine. Bone broth contains
  the minerals calcium and magnesium, both of which
  have anti-stress properties and support relaxation.

- Fruit and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. The sugar
  (fruit) and salt (cheese) will bring down stress hor-
  mones. The calcium in cheese will inhibit PTH.
  Be sure to consume each snack slowly. Eating or drinking
  too fast can be stressful to the body.

### Exercise

Exercise is stress and can lower thyroid function. A healthy person can handle intense, stressful exercise. A hypo-metabolic person should refrain from intense exercise until he or she shows improvements in symptoms. Weight training, due to its muscle-increasing results, is the best form of exercise for body composition changes.

Eat supportively before, during, and after a workout to support thyroid function. The more intense and longer your workout, the more you need to eat.

Water consumption should be based on thirst, not a set amount, like 64 ounces or eight glasses of water a day. Warmer weather, a high metabolic rate, and more activity will require more water--and more minerals. Water is obtained by not only water drinking but also by the food we eat, and our body produces water through energy production.

If you are going to drink more fluids due to heat, humidity, of excess exercise, consume adequate amounts of salt and sugars to help support electrolyte levels and metabolic health.

### Signs of a High Metabolic Rate:

- Body temperature with a thermometer:
  - 97.8 F (36.6 C) upon waking
  - 98.6 F (37 C) mid-day
- Pulse 75-90 bpm
- Warm feet, hands, and nose all day.
- 1-3 bowel movements/ day
- Urinating 4-5 times/day, not 10-12 times/day
- Good hormone function: healthy sex drive, no PMS,fertile
- Shiny hair, smooth and healthy skin, strong nails
- 7-9 hours deep, uninterrupted sleep
- Feel happy and content
- Have good energy all day
- Maintain your weight without dieting and excessive exercise
